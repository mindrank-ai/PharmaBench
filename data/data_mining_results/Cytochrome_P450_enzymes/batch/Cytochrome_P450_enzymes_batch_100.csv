105,"Total SPA Assay: The assays were performed in U-bottom 384-well optiplates. The final assay volume was 15 ul prepared from 7.5 ul additions of microsomes (prepared as a high-speed pellet from homogenized HEK2 cells stably transfected with CYP17), substrates (3H-Pregnenolone and NADPH) and test compounds in assay buffer (50 mM Potassium phosphate pH 7.2, 10% glycerol). The reaction was initiated by the combination of the microsomes and substrates in wells containing compound. The reaction was incubated at room temperature for 45 minutes and terminated by adding 7.5 ul of 0.2N HCl to each well. Following an incubation period of 10 minutes, anti-DHEA-coated SPA beads were added to the terminated reaction. The plate was sealed and incubated overnight with shaking at 4 C. The beads were allowed to settle in the plate for 1 hour and the plate read on a TOPCOUNT (Perkin-Elmer) plate reader.Inhibition data were calculated by comparison to no enzyme control reactions for 100% inhibition.",CYP17,"incubated at room temperature for 45 mins, overnight shaking at 4 C","room temperature, overnight shaking at 4 C",pH 7.2,3H-Pregnenolone,,NADPH,SPA assay with TOPCOUNT reading,stably transfected HEK2 cells,HEK2 cells transfected with human gene,True
